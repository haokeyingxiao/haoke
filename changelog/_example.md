# Upgrade Information

## Asset System Refactoring
### Flysystem adapters
With 6.3 we have refactored the url handling of including resources like images, js, css etc. We have also created three new adapters: `asset` (plugin public files), `theme` (theme resources) and `sitemap`.
For comparability reason they inherit from the `public` filesytem. So after the update all new filesystem are using the config from public filesystem.

All file system configuration have now an `url` config option, this url will be used for url generation to the files.

### Usage of the Symfony asset
To unify the URL generation, we create a Symfony asset for each public filesystem adapter. This will build the correct URL with a version cache busting.
These assets are prefixed in dependency injection with `shopware.asset.{ADAPTER_NAME}`:  
*  `shopware.asset.public`
*  `shopware.asset.theme`
*  `shopware.asset.asset`

Example in PHP:
```
// This is an example. Please use dependency injection
$publicAsset = $container->get('shopware.asset.public');
```

```
// Get the full url to the image
$imageUrl = $publicAsset->getUrl('folder/image.png');
```

Example in Twig:
```
{{ asset('folder/image.png', 'public') }
```

Example in SCSS
```
body {
  background: url("#{$sw-asset-theme-url}/bundles/storefront/assets/img/some-image.webp");
}
```

To access in scss the asset url, you can use the variable `$sw-asset-theme-url`.
