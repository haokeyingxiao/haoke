# Core

___
# Administration
* Added `equalsAll` and `notEqualsAll` condition to the `productFilterTypes` and to the `uuid` `operatorSets` of `Resources/app/administration/src/app/service/product-stream-condition.service.js`
* Changed the visibility of the multi id select field for the `equalsAll` and `notEqualsAll` condition
