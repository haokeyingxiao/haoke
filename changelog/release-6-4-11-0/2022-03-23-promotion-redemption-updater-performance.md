# Core
* Added write protected column `promotionId` to `order_line_item` to allow for better indexing
* Changed `Shopware\Core\Checkout\Promotion\DataAbstractionLayer\PromotionRedemptionUpdater` to only increment totals of `promotions` when order is placed
* Changed `Shopware\Core\Checkout\Promotion\DataAbstractionLayer\PromotionRedemptionUpdater` to recalculate totals of `promotions` when indexing occurs
