# Administration
* Added plugin for the VueDevtools (only available in version 6+) to find out the positionId's of the extension points
* Added component sections before and after a card
* Added the property `positionIdentifier` to the `sw-card` (required in next major)
* Added a componentSection component for rendering custom UIs via the ExtensionAPI
* Added a iframe-renderer component for rendering iFrames with specific locationIds
