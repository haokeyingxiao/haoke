# Administration
*  Added `countryCriteria` in `src/module/sw-customer/component/sw-customer-address-form/index.js` to sort countries by position.
___
# Storefront
*  Changed `Resources/views/storefront/component/address/address-form.html.twig` to preselect country, whenever only one country is available in the sales channel.
