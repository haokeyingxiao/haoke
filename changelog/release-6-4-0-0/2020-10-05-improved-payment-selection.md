# Upgrade Information
## Confirm checkout page / account edit order page
- On the `confirm checkout page` and `account edit order page`, the modal to change the payment or shipping method was removed.
- Instead, a maximum of `5` per default payment and shipping methods will be shown instantly.
- All other methods will be hidden under a JavaScript controlled collapse and may be triggered to appear by user interaction.
