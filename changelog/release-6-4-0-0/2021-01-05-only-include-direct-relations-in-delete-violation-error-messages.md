# Core
* Added new optional parameter `$restrictDeleteOnlyFirstLevel` in order to only include entities directly associated with the definition to the following methods:
    * `Shopware\Core\Framework\DataAbstractionLayer\Dbal\EntityForeignKeyResolver::getAffectedDeleteRestrictions`
    * `Shopware\Core\Framework\DataAbstractionLayer\Dbal\EntityForeignKeyResolver::fetch`
    * `Shopware\Core\Framework\DataAbstractionLayer\Dbal\EntityForeignKeyResolver::fetchAssociation`
